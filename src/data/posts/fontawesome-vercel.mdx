Whilst making this website, I opted to use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)'s icons as they have such an expansive library available.

On top of that, I decided to use their Pro library, however once deploying, the build would fail with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) due to a lack of permissions to install the required packages.

### Solution

The simplest way to resolve this is to create a `.npmrc` file at the root of your Next.js application, like so:

```js:.npmrc
@fortawesome:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken=YOUR_FONTAWESOME_TOKEN_HERE
```

- You can find your token [here](https://fontawesome.com/account).
- Make sure this file isn't pushed to a **public repository**, as it has a confidential token.

Alternatively, you can create an [environment variable](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables) on your Vercel project named `NPM_RC` with the same content as above.

ðŸŽ‰ After this, deploy your application to Vercel and the required Pro packages will be resolvable!
